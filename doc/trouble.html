	<h2>While compiling</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong>Compilation fails (errors during "<code>make</code>")</strong>

  <dd>The most common causes are &nbsp;:
    <dl>
      <br>
      <dt>You don't have GNU make.
      <dd>If you type "<code>make&nbsp;--version</code>", you should see
	something that starts with
	"<code>GNU&nbsp;Make&nbsp;version&nbsp;something</code>".  Otherwise,
	you don't have GNU make. Installing GNU make is not very difficult.
	Fetch the archive <code>make-<var>version</var>.tar.gz</code> from
	<code>ftp.gnu.org</code>, extract its contents, type
	"<code>./configure; make; su -c 'make install'</code>" and you're set.
	Don't worry, this is not going to overwrite your old make program. The
	new make program is installed as <code>/usr/bin/local/make</code>. Use
	that to compile and install Yadex.

      <br>
      <br>
      <dt>"<code>cc/c++: command not found</code>"
      <dd>You don't have a C or C++ compiler. You could install EGCS or GCC
        (they're free).

      <br>
      <br>
      <dt>"<code>-lX11</code>: no such file or directory"
      <dd>The linker can't find the X11 libraries.  Make sure that you
	have one or more files named "<code>libX11*</code>" on your system and
	that they are in <code>/usr/X11R6/lib</code>. If they're somewhere
	else, try typing "<code>make&nbsp;X11LIBDIR=/somewhere/else</code>"
	instead.

      <br>
      <br>
      <dt>"<code>no space left on device</code>".
      <dd>Your disk is full :-).

      <br>
      <br>
      <dt>Something else
      <dd>Mail me the output of "<code>make showconf</code>", the command you
        ran and the error messages you got.
    </dl>
</dl>

	<h2>While installing</h2>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Installation fails (errors during
  "<code>make&nbsp;install</code>")</strong>

  <dd>The most common causes are&nbsp;:
    <dl>
      <br>
      <dt>"<code>permission denied</code>".
      <dd>You don't have the necessary rights to copy the files to the
	installation directories. Either try logging in as <code>root</code>
	and running "<code>make install</code>" again or specifying another
	target directory.

      <br>
      <br>
      <dt>"<code>no space left on device</code>".
      <dd>Your disk is full :-).
      
      <br>
      <br>
      <dt>Something else
      <dd>Mail me the output of "<code>make showconf</code>", the command you
        ran and the error messages you got.
    </dl>
</dl>

	<h2>While running</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong>Error message "<code>Can't open ".../doom2.wad" (No such file or
    directory)</code>"</strong>

  <dd>
    Yadex can't find your Doom II iwad. Either&nbsp;:
    <ul>
      <li>
	copy it or symlink it to
	<code>/usr/local/share/games/doom2/doom2.wad</code> or
      <li>
	change the <code>iwad2=</code> parameter in
	<code>/usr/local/etc/yadex.cfg</code>.
    </ul>

  <br>
  <dt>
    <strong>Error message "<code>invalid option: "-something"</code>"</strong>

  <dd>
    Yadex wants a space between options and their argument. For example,
    "<code>yadex&nbsp;-g&nbsp;doom</code>" is okay,
    "<code>yadex&nbsp;-gdoom</code>" isn't.

  <br>
  <br>
  <dt>
    <strong>The display lags behind when I drag objects or scroll</strong>

  <dd>
    Yes. Yadex takes too much time to redraw its window. This kill be fixed in
    another release. In the meantime, you can try to&nbsp;:
    <ul>
      <li>run Yadex with the <code>-P</code> option (but you'll get more
	flicker),
      <li>use a smaller window&nbsp;,
      <li>use a lesser screen depth, such as 8 BPP,
      <li>keep the grid step large or disable the grid completely,
      <li>use more powerful hardware.
    </ul>

  <br>
  <dt><strong>The window has turned black&nbsp;!</strong>

  <dd>Don't panic. This is a known bug, and a totally harmless
    one. Yadex is not crashed or hung. It just didn't realize that its window
    has been erased and needs to be redrawn. It still accepts input, though the
    display might look funny. If that disturbs you, you can back out by
    pressing [<kbd>Esc</kbd>], several times if necessary, and everything will
    return to normal.
